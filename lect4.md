# Types of Variables
```cpp
int x=6; //Ordinary Variable

int *p;  //Pointer Variable
p = &x;

int &y=x; //Reference Variable
y++;
cout << x; //7

```

## Reference Varible 
- Reference means address.
- Reference variable is an internal Pointer.
- Declaration of Reference varible is preceded with '&' symbol (but do not red it as 'address of').
- Reference variable must be initialized during declaration
- It can be initialized with already declared variables only.
- Reference variable cannot be updated.
